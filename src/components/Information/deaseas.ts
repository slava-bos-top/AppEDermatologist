        name: "Actinic keratosis",
        info: "ACTIVE KERATOSIS is a pathological change in the skin that occurs under the influence of UV radiation. It is considered a pre-cancerous condition, so it requires timely treatment. Solar keratosis develops gradually and is more common at the age of 40 and older, even when sun exposure is limited. Due to this mechanism of development, the disease is very rarely diagnosed in children. Whatever the reasons for the diagnosis of actinic keratosis, treatment should be started as early as possible, because the disease can progress to a more serious stage - squamous cell carcinoma. The neoplasm usually develops on the skin of the head, face, and hands. It is less commonly detected in other areas.",
        treat: "Keratosis actinicus manifests itself in the form of pink, red, gray, yellow, brown or white papules with redness around the lesion. Neoplasms are well felt to the touch because they are covered with rough scales. Sometimes, due to their light color, they go unnoticed visually, but can be felt from the moment they appear."

        name: "Atopic dermatitis",
        info: "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory recurrent skin disease characteristic of both children and adults. The disease affects 10% of the world's population. The main manifestation of atopic dermatitis is constant dryness of the face and/or body skin, itching and irritation.",
        treat: "Dry and irritated skin leads to inflammation and itching. Constant itching can lead to constant scratching. It damages the skin barrier, which promotes a moist environment for bacterial growth. This, in turn, causes irritation and further itching and inflammation. Thus, the cycle of atopic skin is closed. Important! Atopic dermatitis requires timely treatment. This will help to quickly reverse the development of skin rashes and achieve long-term remission."

        name: "Доброякісний кератоз",
        info: "Доброякісний кератоз — доброякісні новоутворення на шкірі, які мають множинний характер. Вони виглядають як плями тілесно-коричневого кольору з чітко окресленими краями. Найчастіше вони охоплюють область грудної клітини, але можуть з’являтися і в інших місцях. Захворювання вражає в основному людей старше 50 років.",
        treat: "Коли розвивається доброякісний кератоз, симптоми зазвичай візуальні. На шкірі з’являються плями, які не викликають дискомфорту та взагалі ніяк не турбують людину. Їхня форма найчастіше кругла або овальна, колір може бути від жовтого до темно-коричневого й навіть чорного. Їхня поверхня може бути бархатистою і лущитися. Іноді плями виглядають, як приклеєні. При діагнозі лікування може й не знадобитися. Якщо плями маленькі, не ростуть і ніяк не турбують людину, їй показане спостереження. У деяких випадках, коли новоутворення розташовані в видимих місцях і порушують естетику зовнішності, їх видаляють. Також це роблять при великих розмірах і активному рості новоутворення."

        name: "Dermatofibroma",
        info: "Dermatofibroma is a common benign skin tumor that differs from other tumors in that it occurs only in adults (women twice as often as men), consists of immune defense cells and skin regeneration cells, which explains its name.",
        treat: "Usually, dermatofibroma on the face or body appears as a single papule (nodule) with a smooth surface. The formation is very similar to a wart or a large mole, as it has a wide base and a variable color of flesh, pink, purple, gray or brown (in case of trauma, it darkens even more). Dermatofibroma is characterized by slow growth and small size (0.5-1.5 cm), most often it is asymptomatic, but it can cause mild physical discomfort in the form of itching and hypersensitivity. Usually, dermatofibroma is removed exclusively as a cosmetic defect."

        name: "Melanocytic nevus",
        info: "Melanocytic nevi are pigmented moles that are often diagnosed in people of all ages, including children. Pigmented moles look like flat or protruding spots of round or oval shape with clear borders and a smooth surface. The color of all melanocytic lesions varies from light brown to deep brown and even black.",
        treat: "The only effective way to treat pigmented nevi is to remove them."

        name: "Melanoma",
        info: "Melanoma is a malignant tumor that develops from pigmented melanocyte cells. This cancerous tumor most often begins its development on the skin or a mole. Rarely, skin cancer is localized in other organs, such as the eyeball, oral mucosa, or under the nail space. It is one of the most dangerous human malignancies, characterized by frequent relapses and metastasizing lymphogenic and hematogenic processes.",
        treat: "At the stage of early detection of possible skin cancer, it is necessary to carefully examine moles for signs of the disease. It is important to examine all areas of the skin, including the scalp, body folds, space between the fingers, feet, and lumbar area. It is recommended to repeat an independent visual examination at least once every six months, or even better, contact a specialist who will conduct a professional examination. Treatment depends on the stage of the disease."

        info: "Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a slow-growing, distally metastasizing, malignant skin tumor of epithelial origin, characterized by cell differentiation towards keratinocytes and is mainly common among people of white race.",
        treat: "If there is clinical suspicion of regional lymph node involvement, an ultrasound of this group of lymph nodes and possibly a fine-needle biopsy should be performed. Confirmation of the diagnosis of cancer requires appropriate imaging studies to look for distant metastases. Treatment for most patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin consists of simple excision of the lesion within healthy tissue."

        name: "Ringworm candidiasis",
        info: "Ringworm candidiasis is a fungal skin disease that belongs to a group of diseases under the general name of dermatomycoses. This pathology occurs as a result of skin damage by filamentous fungi of the genus Trichophyton (Trichophytia) or Microsporum (Microsporia). This disease can be contracted at any age through contact with a sick person or animal. It should be noted that young children and pregnant women are at risk due to the physiological characteristics of the immune system.",
        treat: "It is not difficult for a doctor to suspect ringworm because the disease has a specific clinical picture. But in order to make a diagnosis, the doctor, in addition to a thorough examination of the patient, needs the results of additional research methods, such as: microscopic examination of the affected skin area; clinical and biochemical blood tests. This disease should be treated by a specialist. The essence of drug therapy is to prescribe antifungal drugs that can be administered topically (ointments, creams) and systemically (tablets)."

        name: "Vascular lesions",
        info: "A vascular lesion is a neoplasm composed primarily of endothelial cells that form abnormal blood vessels. The term vascular lesion can be applied to a broad group of diseases, including benign (non-cancerous) tumors, intermediate (locally aggressive) tumors, malignant (cancerous) tumors, congenital/developmental anomalies, and reactive conditions. Vascular lesions can occur in any part of the body, although they are most commonly found on the skin.",
        treat: "At the slightest suspicion of a vascular problem, you should consult an angiologist or phlebologist. The functions of these specialists are often performed by vascular surgeons."
